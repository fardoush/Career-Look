    "question": "When Should you use context Api?",
    "answer":"Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels. Apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult. If you only want to avoid passing some props through many levels, component composition is often a simpler solution than context."

    "question": "What is coustom hook?",
    "answer":"A custom Hook is a JavaScript function whose name starts with ”use” and that may call other Hooks. That's it! If you have code in a component that you feel would make sense to extract, either for reuse elsewhere or to keep the component simpler, you can pull that out into a function."

    "question": "What isuseMemo?",
    "answer":"React has a built-in hook called useMemo that allows you to memoize expensive functions so that you can avoid calling them on every render. You simple pass in a function and an array of inputs and useMemo will only recompute the memoized value when one of the inputs has changed."
